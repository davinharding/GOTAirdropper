# GOT Airdropper

This is a smart contract that handles the distribution and claiming of a reward token for stakers to a specified Guardian node.  It also includes some helpful deploy scripts, a merkleTree generator script, automated unit tests and a Reward Token contract that emulates the one generated from the native Theta token minter to be used for testing purposes.
